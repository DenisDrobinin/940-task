# The Yeti 

#### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

[^1]Abominable Snowman (Nepali: हिममानव, lit. "mountain man") is an
ape-like cryptid taller than an average human that is said to inhabit
the Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet. The names Yeti and Meh-Teh are
commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of
their history and mythology. Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a
facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century.

The scientific community generally regards the Yeti as a legend, given
the lack of conclusive evidence, but it remains one of the most famous
creatures of cryptozoology. Analysis of samples associated with claimed
yetis found a sequence of mitochondrial DNA that matched a sample from
an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Norway, that dates back to
between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago.

Other terms used by Himalayan peoples do not translate exactly the same,
but refer to legendary and indigenous wildlife:

 -Michê

-Dzu

-teh

 -Migoi or Mi-go
